## Project Description

**Why is it important or interesting**
-This project is important for us due to our interest in becoming future game developers. This would be our first step into the field of video game development. In addition, we also share the same interest by having played many turn-based RPGs in the past such as Pokemon and Final Fantasy. 

**Languages, tools and tech**
-Our chosen IDE will be VScode as this is what we are most comfortable and familiar with. Along with VScode, we will code in C++ as that is our shared primary coding language. 

**Input/Outputs**
-Like any turn-based RPG, we will need user input. These inputs will be entered by the user through the terminal. These inputs will be for various things  character selection, story path choices, and battle actions. Based on the user input, different outputs will be displayed to the terminal. For example, if the user chooses to go right instead of left 

The output will display "_characterName_ walks down the right path". User actions such as attacks or moves will also be displayed back to the user. During combat, we will display the user's health, attack choices, and item choices along with the enemy's health and next attack. This is all in the hope of providing a real RPG-like experience without the fancy graphics. 

**Features**
-All of the displays would be through text, however, we are going to aim for a dynamic approach where live user inputs will result in live outputs. In addition, since this would be a text-turned-based RPG we will aim to have the user's actions affect the storyline. The story will be linear as the character starts in a town and ventures to an ancient realm to defeat the big evil, but throughout the story, we will prompt the user to choose certain actions that will result in a different ending or acquire certain items. For example, if the user chooses to help the poor man he will be rewarded with a legendary sword, or the user can save his money. After everything is put together we should have a playable text-turned-based RPG with an amazing story that is reflected upon the user's actions.
